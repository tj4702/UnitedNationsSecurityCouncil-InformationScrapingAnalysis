His book, Collaborative Advantage: Forging Green Industries in the New Global Economy (Oxford University Press, 2021), uses the development of renewable energy sectors to investigate the political economy of innovation and industrial development in highly globalized industries. The book shows that new possibilities for collaboration among firms in the global economy have reinforced national patterns of industrial specialization.
